# Twatter

This is a shameless Twitter "clone" that we call #Twatter. It's built with React, Typescript, Material UI, MongoDB and Express.
We built this as an assignment in our class "Dynamic Web Development. We had to incorperate all our skills in both front end and back end to make this work.


This project was made by [Asaf LÃ¤ckgren](https://github.com/intradastingly), [Sebastian Zazzi](https://github.com/zazzzi) & [Alexander Liljedahl](https://github.com/supertramps)
